# MPDD Baseline Code
The baseline system provided for the MM 2025 MPDD Challenge serves as a starting point for participants to develop their solutions for the Multimodal Personalized Depression Detection tasks. The baseline system is designed to be straightforward yet effective, providing participants with a solid foundation upon which they can build and improve.

# Results
The metrics reported are weighted/unweighted F1-score(W_F1/U_F1) and weighted/unweighted accuracy (W_Acc./U_Acc.) with and without personalized features (PF) for the MPDD-Young and MPDD-Elderly datasets. Each value represents the best-performing feature combination for each experiment, using default hyper-parameters.

# Features

In our baseline, we use the following features:

### Acoustic Feature:
**Wav2vec：** We extract utterance-level acoustic features using the wav2vec model pre-trained on large-scale audio data. The embedding size of the acoustic features is 512.  
The link of the pre-trained model is: [wav2vec model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/wav2vec)

**MFCCs：** We extract Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The embedding size of MFCCs is 64.  

**OpenSmile：** We extract utterance-level acoustic features using opensmile. The embedding size of OpenSMILE features is 6373.  

### Visual Feature:
**Resnet-50 and Densenet-121：** We employ OpenCV tool to extract scene pictures from each video, capturing frames at a 10-frame interval. Subsequently, we utilize the Resnet-50 and Densenet-121 model to generate utterance-level features for the extracted scene pictures in the videos. The embedding size of the visual features is 1000 for Resnet and 1024 for Densenet.
The links of the pre-trained models are:  
 [ResNet-50](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-50)  
 [DenseNet-121](https://huggingface.co/pytorch/vision/v0.10.0/densenet121)  

**OpenFace：** We extract csv visual features using the pretrained OpenFace model. The embedding size of OpenFace features is 709. You can download the executable file and model files for OpenFace from the following link: [OpenFace Toolkit](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace)

### Personalized Feature:
We generate personalized features by loading the GLM3 model, creating personalized descriptions, and embedding these descriptions using the `roberta-large` model. The embedding size of the personalized features is 1024.

After obtaining the dataset, users should modify `data_rootpath` in the scripts during training and testing. Notice that testing data will be made public in the later stage of the competition.

`data_rootpath`:

    ├── Training/
    │   ├──1s
    │   ├──5s
    │   ├──individualEmbedding
    │   ├──labels
    ├── Testing/
    │   ├──1s
    │   ├──5s

## Training
To train the model with default parameters, taking MPDD-Young for example, simply run:  

```bash
cd path/to/MPDD   # replace with actual path
```
```bash
bash scripts/Track2/train_1s_binary.sh
```

You can also modify parameters such as feature types, split window time, classification dimensions, or learning rate directly through the command line:  
```bash
bash scripts/Track2/train_1s_binary.sh --audiofeature_method=wav2vec --videofeature_method=resnet --splitwindow_time=5s --labelcount=3 --batch_size=32 --lr=0.001 --num_epochs=500
```
Refer to `config.json` for more parameters.

The specific dimensions of each feature are shown in the table below:
| Feature                  | Dimension |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Wav2vec                 | 512       |
| MFCCs                   | 64        |
| OpenSmile               | 6373      |
| ResNet-50               | 1000      |
| DenseNet-121            | 1024      |
| OpenFace                | 709       |
| Personalized Feature    | 1024      |


## Testing
To predict the labels for the testing set with your obtained model, first modify the default parameters in `test.sh` to match the current task, and run:  

```bash
cd path/to/MPDD   # replace with actual path
```
```bash
bash scripts/test.sh
```
After testing 6 tasks in Track1 or 4 tasks in Track2, the results will be merged into the `submission.csv` file in `./answer_Track2/`.
